# LoreTracker Privacy Policy

*Last updated: 23 January 2025*

## Disclaimer
LoreTracker is an unofficial app created by fans, for fans. 
This app is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Disney, Ravensburger, or Disney Lorcanaâ„¢ in any way. 
All trademarks and copyrights belong to their respective owners.

## Overview
We believe in transparent privacy practices and minimal data collection. 
This privacy policy explains what anonymous information we collect and why.

## What Information We Collect
The following anonymous information can be stored:
- Basic device information (derived from system information; the original data is not stored)
- Screen size
- Country name derived from the IP address
- App usage statistics

For session management, GoatCounter temporarily keeps a hash of:
- IP address
- User-Agent
- Random number ("salt")
  This hash is only kept in process memory for 8 hours to identify browsing sessions and is never stored to disk.

No personal information is collected. We do not store IP addresses.

The only data stored on your device is:
- Your game scores (stored in localStorage)
- No other cookies, localStorage items, or other methods of storage are used

## How We Use This Information
We collect this minimal anonymous data solely to:
- Understand how users interact with the app
- Improve app performance
- Make informed decisions about future updates
- Ensure compatibility across different devices

## Legal Basis for Processing
Our collection of anonymous usage data is based on legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) to improve our app's 
functionality and user experience.

## Data Storage and Security
- Anonymous data is processed using [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/), an open-source, privacy-focused analytics service
- All data processing occurs in the Republic of Ireland
- Anonymous usage statistics are retained indefinitely to allow for long-term analysis of app usage patterns
- No information is shared with third parties

## Compliance
We have chosen GoatCounter as our analytics provider due to their privacy-focused approach and commitment to minimal
data collection. As a developer based in the EU, we ensure our usage of GoatCounter complies with GDPR requirements.

## Your Rights
Since we only collect anonymous data that cannot be linked to individuals, 
most GDPR rights (such as access, rectification, erasure) do not apply as we have no way to identify individual users 
in our analytics data. Your game scores are stored locally on your device and can be cleared by clearing the app's cache.

## Required Permissions
The app requires:
- Internet access: Used only for anonymous usage statistics

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Users will be notified of any changes through app updates.
